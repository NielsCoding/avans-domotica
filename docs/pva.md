# Project result
In year 2 of avans hogeschool blok 2 is the project is domitica. With this project we are going to realise a domotica system using bluetooth mesh.
## Problem analysis
Most household don't have a domitica system. The ligtswitches turn the light on by a physical connection and can only do that, But with a domitica system this can by solved.
## Issue
The question arises, why there isn't more households that uses a domotica system? The answer to that question is, The system is for most people confusing, But with the right explenation and easy-to-use can everyone have a domotica system in their household.
## Objective
Our objective is to make a working domotica system with the use of bluetooth mesh. the system consists of minimal three sensors and three lights that comminicate in a mesh network. This can then by implemented in a household.
## Final result
With our domotica system that is user friendly and easy-to-use everybody can make their house a domotica system
# Phasing
For project casaDomitica are we using scrum as our tool for planning.

## Description phases
There are different steps were taking for this project. The first step is Plan van Aanpak also know as Plan. Then were describing the requirements. After the requirments comes our sprints. there are a total of three sprints were doing this project.


### Plan
For the planning and our actions see our trello bord with this link.

### Requirements


### Sprint 1
In this sprint were mostly doing research about different subjects of domitca. Additionally, are we testing the different subjects to further understand domitca. For exaample, researching and testing bluetooth mesh.

### Sprint 2
In this sprint were using the knowlodge of sprint 1 to start building our domitica system. Also, if further research is needed this sprint can be used for this.

### Sprint 3
In this Sprint were finishing the domitca system if finishing is needed. Most of the time is needed for testig and debugging.

# Project boundaries
The project has a few bounderies. The minimal requirements is that is works with three switches and three lights. Therefore using our domitica system for relaying numeric values is not possible, for now atleast. additionally, it is an domotica system which means it cannot be used in a industrial environment. And the last bounderie, Is the system needs to use our GUI and does not work with other GUI.
